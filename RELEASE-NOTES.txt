[Changes]
- Remove f13 from FEDORA_CURRENT_RELEASE_TAGS, as Fedora 13 is end of life.
- ManageMessages: New module.
- ManageRelease: New module.
- Now manageReleaseOnFedora include ManageMaintainerTargets
- Modules are shown what they include and included by.
- Now tag depends on koji_scratch_build, while fedpkg_commit master
  (or other primary branch) depends directly on tag.
