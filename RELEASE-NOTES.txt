[Changes]
- Remove f13 from FEDORA_CURRENT_RELEASE_TAGS, as Fedora 13 is end of life.
- ManageMessage: New module.
  + M_MSG: Controllable verbose output
- ManageRelease: New module.
  + MANAGE_RELEASE: Make release by uploading files to hosting services
- Now ManageReleaseOnFedora includes ManageMaintainerTargets
- Modules are shown what they include and included by.
- Now tag depends on koji_scratch_build, while fedpkg_commit master
  (or other primary branch) depends directly on tag.
- MAINTAINER_SETTING_READ_FILE now can either use MAINTAINER_SETTING, or take
  one argument that define maintainer setting file.
- MANAGE_MAINTAINER_TARGETS_UPLOAD no longer require argument hostService,
  It now relies on HOSTING_SERVICES from maintainer setting file.
